# Mr-Bitcoin
## Project Overview
Mr. BitCoin is a digital responsive wallet application built with Vue.js. This app allows users to manage their Bitcoin balance and simulate transactions to contacts. Although no real funds are involved, this frontend-only application provides functionality for managing a virtual wallet, including transferring Bitcoins, managing contacts, and visualizing Bitcoin-related data.
The project demonstrates Vue concepts such as services, routing, components, CRUDL operations, and data fetching from external APIs to render charts.

## Features
- Home Page: Displays the userâ€™s name, balance, and current Bitcoin rate.
- Contacts Page: Lists all contacts and allows users to filter, add, edit, and delete contacts.
- Contact Details Page: Shows detailed information about a contact, allows Bitcoin transfers, and displays a history of transactions with the contact.
- User Authentication: Simple signup page to store and manage user information locally.
- CRUDL Operations: Full Create, Read, Update, Delete, and List functionality for managing contacts.
- Statistics Page: Visualizes Bitcoin market data with charts.

## Services
- ContactService: Manages contact data including fetching, adding, editing, and removing contacts.
- UserService: Manages user data and handles user authentication, balance management, and transactions.
- BitcoinService: Fetches Bitcoin-related data from external APIs (e.g., market price, average block size).
